### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Nikolas and I am a software developer

Since 2014, I've worked in the fitness industry, training athletes of all ages. While I always dabbled in coding, in 2023 I decided to pursue it full time. I started by diving into free online resources like Harvard's CS50, which helped me build a strong foundation in software engineering. Along the way, I created various small projects in Python, such as a home automation system with a Raspberry Pi and an emulation of the mobile game 2048.

Wanting to push myself further, I enrolled in a bootcamp called Tech Elevator, and soon I was writing full-stack applications. While I'm not certain what the future holds, I know that Iâ€™ll continue to grow, learn, and challenge myself every day.
