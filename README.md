### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Hereâ€™s a revised version of your text with corrected spelling and grammar:

My name is Nikolas, and I am a software developer.

Since 2014, Iâ€™ve worked in the fitness industry, training athletes of all ages. While I always dabbled in coding, in 2023, I decided to pursue it full-time. I started by exploring free online resources like Harvardâ€™s CS50, which helped me build a strong foundation in software engineering. Along the way, I created various small projects in Python, such as a home automation system with a Raspberry Pi and an emulation of the mobile game 2048.

Wanting to push myself further, I enrolled in a bootcamp called Tech Elevator, a 14-week full-time software engineering course. The bootcamp culminated in an intensive two-week group project that simulated an Agile environment. Through hard work and dedication, my team produced FitBuddy, a workout companion app, which can be viewed below.

Since graduation, Iâ€™ve continued to grow and work on projects. Iâ€™m currently developing a financial management application, which can also be viewed below, and Iâ€™m hoping to launch it in the not-so-distant future. I am very proud of all Iâ€™ve accomplished, especially over the past year, and Iâ€™ll continue to grow, learn, and challenge myself every day.
